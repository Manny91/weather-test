# WeatherApp

This is a city weather search app that allows to the user to search a city by name and it will display the temperatures of the day.

I've used latest version of angular-cli and ngrx-store for the application state management.


for running the project once cloned the repository locally by doing:

 `git clone https://mcaero@bitbucket.org/mcaero/weather-test.git`

after that need to access to the app folder by doing:

`cd weather-app`

after that all the node-modules dependencies needs to be installed, please run:

`npm install`

and then

`ng serve` will create a dev server and run the application in the local machine.
 Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see the app working.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
